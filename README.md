### Description

This Space Stage mod makes certain aspects of the stage much less grindy and tedious, and overall strives to make the stage more enjoyable in general. This doesn't add anything brand new into the game though, but it should better the vanilla experience. With that being said though, there are some new things here and there...

> Note : This is still a WIP mod, I will add in updates from time to time. Don't rely entirely on this mod for general playthrough purposes. Provide feedback on the "Issues" tab for anything that would need fixing or re-balancing. I will try my best to listen to them.

## General Changes
- Building Price Reductions
      
      - Entertainment = $6,400 (Original = $12,800)
       
      - Factory = $14,400 (Original = $19,200)
       
      - House = $12,800 (Original = $25,600)
- Re-arranged the tools in the "My Collections" window. For instance, tools with upgrades are grouped in the same row.
- Planets that turn into adventures will quickly revert to normal once another adventure is played
- Increases the time it takes for another disaster to start (now 10 minutes instead of 2 minutes)
- Alien cities will never have a chance to be destroyed when the player captures it

## Badge Changes
- Reduced the requirements for the following badges

      - Eco-Hero (lv5 requires 10 of the exterminate missions instead of 50)
      - Frequent Flyer (lv5 requires 750 star systems instead of 1,500)

- Increased the requirements for "Golden Touch" (lv4 requires $25 million instead of $5 million)

## Tool Changes/Additions
- Added a FOURTH, DELUXE tier upgrade (does 25% more damage than previous upgrade) for the following weapons

       - Proton Missile
       - Laser
       - Auto Blaster
       - Pulse
- Added an upgrade to the Colony Incredi-pak, the "Colony Infini-pak". It can be used infinitely!
- Added "Rechargable Battery", an upgradable tool that can replenish the player's energy. While it can be used infinitely, the cooldown takes a long while.
- Added "Nanobot Regen", an upgradable tool that can replenish the player's health. While it can be used infinitely, the cooldown takes a long while.
- Hologram Scout can be obtained at the start of the stage for FREE.
- Planet scan can be used infinitely, but uses up a good amount of energy
- Planet busters are banned from the galactic market. The player can only purchase this weapon from their own empire.
- Landscaping tools and paints are no longer considered as "rares". With the exception of the "reset color" tool, planets should not have these appear anymore.

## New Achetype Exclusive Trades

  Coloring and landscaping tools are no longer found as "rares" on a planet. Instead, they will be found as purchasable tools on specific archetypes.
  
  >Please Note that not all tools have been made purchasable. Next to each tool name are a pair of brackets ( [ ] ). If they look like this ( [X] ), that means that the tool is
  >purchasable. If the brackets are empty, then they have yet to be added.
  >
  >Also note that there is currently a "DUMMY" tool on sale. When the mod is finalized, that tool will be removed from the game
